            <h2 class="w3-center">About Us</h2>
            <!-- <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>What is this about</i></p><br> -->
            <p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>We are a team of junior doctors who are dedicated to changing the way medical students
            study for exams.</i></span></p>
            <p class="p3"><span class="s3"><i>Our mission is to empower medical students to use the evidence-based principles of
            active recall, spaced repetition and concept mapping to maximise recall of content, helping students achieve
            outstanding exam results while retaining this information for use in clinical practice</i></span>
            </p>
            <p class="p7"><span class="s1"><span>We believe that the vast majority of medical students in the UK are
        not studying effectively, investing long periods of study time to tasks which will have a negligible impact on their
                performance on exam day. At MedicRecall, we want to change this.</span></span></p>
            <p class="p7"><span class="s1">Currently students at schools and universities are taught what content to learn but not
          how to learn it. Therefore, there is a large disconnect between cutting edge cognitive science research into
          effective studying techniques and what is being used in practice. Over the last decade there is now a consensus that
          there are 3 methods proven to be most effective at maximising understanding and exam performance: active recall,
          spaced repetition and concept mapping.You can see the difference these
          methods make on exam performance from the graph below (Karpincke et al. ). Repeated study, concept mapping and
          active recall practice each almost doubled performance on exam performance. Imagine if you could harness the power
          of all three techniques in the way you revise!</span></p>
            <p class="p8"><span class="s1"></span></p>
            <p class="p7"><span class="s1">Therefore, our aim is make employing these techniques as easy as possible for students.
          How can we do this? By setting up a comprehensive platform with pre-made,
          verified content delivered in a format which can tap into the benefits of each one of these methods.</span>
            </p>

    <!-- The SJT Course Section -->
    <div class="w3-white" id="SJT course">
        <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px">
            <h2 class="w3-center">SJT Course</h2>
            <p class="p7"><span class="s1">The SJT is a hugely important exam which is given equal importance to your entire
          academic performance during medical school in determining which foundation year jobs you are allocated to. We have
          targeted this exam as our team have found that this is the exam where evidence-based revision methods could make the
          biggest impact in how medical students prepare.</span></p>
            <p class="p7"><span class="s1">For our SJT course we have split each of the 8 key domains tested in this exam into decks
          of flashcards. Each deck is further subdivided into common topics and themes to help users gain an understanding of
          what is examined in the SJT meaning users can identify which category a question may testing (concept mapping).
          Additionally we deliver our peer-reviewed content in flashcard format with a unique algorithm which will prompt
          users to review the content that they found most challenging at spaced intervals. This content can be reviewed on
          our desktop site or our mobile application so that students can fit extra SJT revision in-between a busy life on
          clinical rotations.</span></p>
            <p class="p7"><span class="s1">We also appreciate that the SJT is a subjective exam meaning that official content
          produced by the UKFPO is the most valuable resource you should use. Therefore, we factor reviewing these mock papers
          into your personalised revision timetable and also provide a unofficial mark scheme to the additional paper
          available on the PearsonVue site (very useful to prompt discussion around these scenarios with your peers and master
          the principles tested in the SJT). As we are in our first year, we offer all our content completely free and only 
          ask that users give us feedback on how we can improve our service.</span></p>
            <p class="p7"><span class="s1">This approach is a stark contrast to what is currently offered by SJT course
          providers. They offer a one-off, day-long lectures (an example of
          low-yield, passive leaning) alongside a bank of practice quesitons for prices up to £100. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="p7"><span class="s1">Therefore, we have created the most comprehensive and only evidence-based revision course
          on the market to help student achieve their 1st choice job while also changing the way you study in the process! All
          for Free!</span></p>
