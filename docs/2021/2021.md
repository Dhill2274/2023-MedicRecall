## 2021-Flashcard

As requested by our client, the purpose of this project is to develop an application capable of helping medical students prepare for the Situational Judgement Test (SJT). This
is done using flashcards that stimulate a recall of the information, encouraging memory retention of the content. This is further aided using our spaced-repetition algorithm, which rearranges the cards based on how difficult the user finds a card; harder ones are shown at a greater rate than easier ones. 

The project has been built using the [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) framework, which allows us to build an app for mobile, desktop & the web from a single codebase.  We are also using Google's Firebase REST API to handle app authentication and to store all of our flashcards.

## How our algorithm works

Users have a freedom of choice. They decide when they want to study new material and when they want to revise. Each time a user sees a card, they can rate how difficult it was for them. 

While revising, the algorithm is designed to persuade the users to engage with flashcards they have struggled the most. This is achieved by making the cards that are viewed less and have higher difficulty rating appear more often.

While studying or revising, the user has the discretion to choose the topic. The context mapping feature, working in sync with the calendar, allows users to track when they have revised a given topic and set reminders to plan spaced repetition. The user can use that feature to track their progress and understand the ideal times for revising topics they have studied before. 

Once confident, the user has access to the quizzes and Mock Paper taken from the official test, allowing them to see the result of their hard work.

## Setting up

### Requirements

If you wish to build MedicRecall yourself, you will need the following components/tools:

* Android Studio (available to download [here](https://developer.android.com/studio))
* An emulator capable of running 
	* Android 6.0 or above or
	* iOS 11 or above
* Flutter Development packages

### Compiling

After you have downloaded the repo, ensure that you are in the root folder, `/flashcard`

To build the app in android, use the command `flutter build apk`

To build the app in iOS, use the command `flutter build ios --release --no-codesign`

To build the app in macOS, use the command 
`flutter create --platforms=macos .` followed by 
`flutter build macos    `

### Running the App

This app is currently in development, and is not being hosted on Google PlayStore or iOS App Store, however if you would like to view the source code, and run further debugging/testing, here are the instructions:

<!--<details>
  <summary>Download the latest release</summary>

<details>
  <summary>Compiling the source code</summary>

First, clone the repo with the following command, or just download the zip.

```
git clone https://github.com/spe-uob/2021-Flashcard.git
```

Then, download either Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA or  Visual Studio Code, with their respective [Flutter editor plugins](https://flutter.io/get-started/editor/). For more information about Flutter installation procedure, check the [official install guide](https://flutter.io/get-started/install/).

Then, install dependencies from pubspec.yaml by running `flutter pub get` from the project root (see [using packages documentation](https://flutter.io/using-packages/#adding-a-package-dependency-to-an-app) for details and how to do this in the editor). 

Next, set up a device to test the application on. If you don't mind running it directly on a web browser, ignore this.

Lastly, type in `flutter run` and the app should compile and run. Enjoy! 

</details>

If you don't want to go through the hassle of the above, we have already compiled the app for use on a web browser. You can directly run the compiled app here:

<details>
  <summary>Run the web app directly</summary>
The app is being hosted on Google Firebase at the following link: 

https://flashcard-6edc2.web.app

When you click it, be sure to allow some time for the app to start up!

## Testing
Continuous Integration and Development (CI/CD) have been implemented in the project through CircleCI and Github Workflows. The tests that are referenced can be found in `/flashcard/tests` and `/flashcard/integration_test`.

- For easy reference, you may view our current testing results which are displayed as status badges [here](#status). If you would like to review the specific commands being executed, you can view the automated testing scripts in our [Github Workflows](https://github.com/spe-uob/2021-Flashcard/actions) or [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/spe-uob/2021-Flashcard?branch=main).

- To run unit tests, use the following command in the root directory ```flutter test```
- To run integration tests, use the following command in the root directory ```flutter test integration_test/integration_test.dart```

You may need to turn off null safety, in which case, add the command ``` --no-sound-null-safety``` to the end of the command.
