- Can you facilitate discharge over the phone?
    - Yes but this is less ideal than face to face and the person on the phone must know the patient well
    - Should be reviewed face to face as soon as possible but you can start the process
- How to bring up a piece of info you think a senior has not taken into account
    - Use a measured approach
    - A good way is to ask for clarification of the issue
    - This should be done in a direct and timely manner
- What is better, going to find a senior colleague when you need their help on the ward or phoning them?
    - Phoning or bleeping is better than going to find senior as it is more timely and means that you do not leave the ward
    - An emergency may happen in the time you are gone and there may be no doctors on the ward to attend to this
- Who to involve when you have prescription concerns?
    - The doc who asked you to prescribe the drug
    - On call pharmacist is good
    - The nurse who will administer the drug also should be informed
    - try and keep it within your team i.e. those who are caring for the patient
- What to do if you forget to handover something and you have left the ward?
    - Think about a direct and timely solution to the problem
    - 1st Contact the member of staff you were meant to hand over to (via telephone not text message)
    - Then look for other ways to get the info across using other staff, preferably to a member of staff with the responsibility of care for the patient (i.e the speciality trainee within your team)
    - A nurse on your ward would be another acceptable option but is not ideal
- If you are told to prescribe a drug which you think is contraindicated, who is most appropriate to ask about it?
    - The senior who asked you to prescribe it
    - Then another senior doctor
    - Another less appropriate option would be to get advice from a ward pharmacist (you cant prescribe a different drug just on their recommendation)
- How to approach translation issues?
    - Best option is to find a doctor who speaks that language
    - If the patient cannot understand English and there is not a translator available, use the phone translator service
    - Do not use family members as translators even if it is urgent as their are confidentiality issues
- Is it acceptable to describe a rash over the phone to a senior?
    - yes - it will ensure that the person knows about the issue and can make an appropriate decision whether to review or not
    - Ideally, you would want them to see the rash but if you are not able to send a picture securely, simply describing it may be the best option
- What if you forget to prescribe maintenance fluids and you are already on the drive home?
    - Calling the ward is ideal
    - Driving back also solves the problem, and is better than texting info
    - Even maintenance IV fluids shouldn't be left until the morning so needs to be resolved
- Rank the order of these people to contact if you have forgotten to review an important test results and have gone home: On call SpR, Nursing staff on the ward, FY1 on your ward, FY1 on another ward
    - F1 on your ward
    - On call reg and explain the situation
    - Phone nursing staff on your ward and get them to contact the F1 (keep within ward team)
    - Other F1 on a different ward
- In an emergency situation, how should you gain consent when the patient does not speak English?
    - Ask for a doctor that speaks polish ideally, consent for the need to have a translator
    - Then translator services,
    - Dont use family members
    - worse is to use drawings or pictures, can lead to information loss
