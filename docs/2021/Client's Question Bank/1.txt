    - Senior nursing and medical staff need to be aware of the incident so that the incident can be logged,
    - Get more info - clarify if the nurse was aware of the instruction or simply missed it - don't assume any blame
    - Inform the ward sister is appropriate
    - Can apologise to the patient for a mistake that has had an impact on them but not immediately necessary
