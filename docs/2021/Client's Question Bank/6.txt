Breaking bad news

- Can you break bad news as an FY1?
    - Yes, Foundation doctors should be trained in breaking bad news and practice this when it is safe to do so
    - You have a duty of candour to your patients so where possible you should be honest with them and this includes breaking bad news
    - However, there are important limitations... you need to be competent enough to respond to any queries or concerns and as an FY1 this will be the case in situations like a new cancer diagnosis or short prognosis
- Practice breaking bad news with a colleague?
    - Learning from role-play should take place in a controlled environment and so is not an appropriate way of preparing to give bad news
- What is considered beyond the competencies of an FY1 with regard to breaking bad news?
    - A new cancer diagnosis
    - Giving patients a short prognosis or tell a patient that they are dying
    - Here you should involve a senior and tell the patient that you will try to chase up the answers for them - do not leave them with nothing
- How to get the best outcome when breaking serious bad news?
    - Arrange for family members to be there when the results are given (if the patient consents to this)
    - Involve the MDT
    - Ensure senior doctors discuss the diagnosis and plan
- Should you offer that a relative to be present when breaking bad news
    - Yes it is best practice to do so as they can offer emotional support, but this is only done with the consent of the patient
- When should you involve the palliative care team?
    - Inappropriate during the diagnosis of a cancer or other disease
    - Should be a decision made by a consultant or registrar once treatment options have been considered

Consent for procedures

- Can you gain consent for procedures as an FY1?
    - Yes but with limitations
    - Can and should consent for procedures such as cannulation that require verbal consent as long as you understand the risks and benefits
    - You should not consent someone for a procedure that requires written consent (such as an operation)
- Who can consent patients for operations?
    - Ideally it will be the person who is performing the operation
    - Need a full licence, a full understanding of the procedure, risks and how to do it
    - The speciality trainee working under a consultant can consent the patients for surgery that will be led by the consultant
- What procedures require written consent?
    - Complex medical treatments which have significant risks
    - If their personal life or employment may be influenced by the procedure
    - If the treatment is part of research
    - Surgery
- Check a patient's understanding of a surgical procedure?
    - Yes, and this should be done if there is any doubt about whether the patient fully understands or indications their consent was not valid
    - However you should not officially consent someone for a surgical procedure

Bleep

- Can you take the bleep of a senior?
    - NO, you are not qualified to answer their bleep
    - Escalate to senior
- What to do with your bleep if it is appropriate to pass it on e.g. breaking bad news to a patient or family member?
    - Give it to a member of your team e.g. SHO
    - However, never ignore a call from your bleep if you get one
- What is a fast bleep?
    - An emergency call - drop everything and go immediately to the ward

Discharge

- Can you discharge a patient?
    - No, you need senior supervision and approval - ideally by a senior who knows the patient well
    - However, this supervision can be facilitated over the phone given parameters have been met (e.g they can go if urine dip is negative).  However, this is less ideal than an in-person conversation
- What to do if the patient asks you to discharge them as they need to go somewhere but the consultant is late for work?
    - ideally, get another senior colleague to discharge - ensures patient safety
    - Can also get verbal permission from your consultant but could be errors here
    - It is better to explain that they might have to wait than just giving them a self-discharge form (FY1 should not do that, especially without trying all other options first)
- What to do if you have a discharge concern but the bed is needed for an acutely ill patient?
    - Always consult a senior colleague
    - F1s are there to make assisted decisions and should not discharge if the situation has changed
    - Having pressure to release a bed is never a good reason to discharge and should not determine your decision to discharge another patient - there is always another way

Jobs

- Can you remove a catheter?
    - Yes
- Can you put in an acetic drain?
    - this is part of the portfolio but you should see one first before attempting it for the first time
- Can you insert an interosseus device?
    - if trained then yes
- What if you are asked to do something you have not done or observed?
    - Tell your senior immediately (away from the patient that you have not done it before)
- Can you initiate non-invasive ventilation if you have seen it being set up once before?
    - No, non-invasive ventilation is CPAP and you need supervision to set up, especially if you have not done this before
    - In this case, you would need to contact your registrar
    - The critical care team will also be able to help if the patient is acutely unwell
- Prescribe methotrexate?
    - No, 'F1 Doctors are not allowed to prescribe, transcribe or administer cytotoxic drugs'
    - With the exception of corticosteroids
- When can you prioritise learning opportunities?
    - when there are no clinical jobs that need to be done in the timeframe in which you are off the wards
    - (Inserting a cannula for a patient which needs to be done by the end of the day is not urgent enough to stop you from taking part in a learning opportunity)
