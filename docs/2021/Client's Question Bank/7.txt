    - Notifiable diseases - required by law - led by seniors
    - HIV partner, you do break confidentiality as safety comes above
    - Child under 13 wanting to have sex
    - Otherwise do nothing
- When should you not inform the patient that you are going to break confidentiality?
    - If police are involved and telling the patient will defeat the purpose of the disclosure
    - Otherwise always inform the patient first, this is good practice as it maintains trust between patients and doctors

    - Yes, but only breach if there is weapons or children (vulnerable dependants) involved
- Can you break confidentiality in the case of knife or gun crime?
    - Yes, Inform the police

- What can constitute a break of confidentiality?
    - Sharing of any information with another party not directly involved in that patients care
    - Not always a name, any identifiable information
- Can you alter old notes?
    - NO, need to always make it clear it is a retrospective change, leaving any original content the same as how it was found
    - This constitutes tampering with evidence and ever should be done
- Who do you approach first if you observe a colleague breaking confidentiality?
    - Approach them first before escalating,
    - This gives them a chance to rectify it or explain why confidentiality needed to be broken
- What to do if you meet someone in sexual health clinic who has an STD and does not want to say who their sexual partners are?
    - Your first priority is to always treat the patient in front of you
    - Then you ask about the other partners and explore why they do not want to tell them
- What to do if a patient says they do illegal drug
    - using illicit drugs is not extreme enough to break confidentiality
    - Unless they are putting themselves or someone else in harm, this could be considered if they have any dependents such as children?
- What to do when a relative is asking for patient info over the phone when the patient is unconscious?
    - Balance risk of confidentiality breach with distress to the family
    - Try and confirm their identity over the phone
    - As she is unconscious, suggest they come in to find out more (i.e. give limited info)
    - Unless they indicate otherwise, it is reasonable to assume that patients would want those closest to them to be kept informed of their general condition and prognosis
- Can you ever withhold a diagnosis to a patient?
    - No, you have a duty to tell them
    - However, you can delay a diagnosis if the patient is confused and unable to understand at the time
- What to do if a relative turns up asking about the condition of a patient?
    - Info cannot be given without consent but telling the relative something that they already know about the patient is allowed and a good option as this may ease any tensions
    - Find the patient and ask if it is okey to give details of their admission
    - Try to be helpful to the relative without compromising confidentitality
- Who do you inform if you have mistakenly compromised patient info e.g. losing a memory stick or leaving notes on the bus?
    - The best thing to do is to report this to information governance
    - Your consultant would also be able to manage this situation
    - Then asking medical defence union is an option but not that helpful
- What should you do if colleagues are discussing a patient in the public canteen but are not using a name?
    - A name does not have to be used for a person to be identified so still should take action
- Should you give data to private companies if they request it?
    - no, it is not appropriate even if anonymised
    - Not within the remit of an FY1
- What to do if you overhear a patient is worried about if their data will be used in trials as the centre is known for its research output?
    - 1) Ask the patient about their concerns
    - 2) Then offer reassurance if appropriate (in the case of clinical study involvement)
    - 3) Then you can try and rectify the issue for the long term (ensure all patients are informed about how their data is used)
- What if relatives want to discuss a diagnosis with you without the patient?
    - First ask the patient if this is ok
    - Then get more info on the patient if unfamiliar
    - Discuss with family and address concerns, potentially with a nurse present
    - Can discuss around something that they already know - (addresses relative demand) but this is a risky conversation as you may inadvertently break confidentiality
- What are appropriate actions if a woman tells you about domestic abuse which threatens minors?
    - Have to tell social services
    - Tell the patient you will do this first
    - Provide contact details for independent advice - a abuse charity
    - Informing your consultant is also a good first action to take - they need to be aware of safeguarding issues as soon as possible
- What to do if a policeman arrives and wants to speak to a patient about an assault
    - Ask the patient if he is happy to speak to the police
    - Inform your senior
    - Dont tell him anything without consent but still facilitate the investigation
