Managing workload

- How should jobs be prioritised as an F1
    - According to clinical urgency
    - Tasks that cannot wait = attending unwell patients + uncontrolled pain
- What to do if a nurse asks you to prescribe fluids while in the middle of another job
    - Prioritising is key so first gather more information by asking if the patient is acutely unwell
    - Then put it on your list of jobs - you may have more urgent things to do
    - Review the patient yourself before passing onto another doctor who might be even busier
- What has priority: a learning opportunity (observing a procedure), stopping an error, answering a patients question and investigating an error further
    - Stop error first
    - Then answer query
    - Then take up the learning if time dependant
    - Finally, investigate error further - not time dependant
- What to do if a nurse approaches you with a new problem and you have an important job to do
    - Best option is to gather more info from the nurse
    - Doing the other important job first and asking them to get more info while you do it is also appropriate but this should be done after finding out more about what the nurse's job is
    - Do not put the responsibility of your patient on another doctor or give inappropriate reassurance
- 3 appropriate actions when you have lots of jobs to do
    - If another F1 is not busy ask them to help
    - Inform your consultant
    - Ask for help from the reg
- What to do if you are assessing an unwell patient and a nurse contacts you to review another patient?
    - Ask for further clinical details including basic obs
    - bleep reg if you cant safely leave the patient you are with

High-pressure scenarios

- What to do if you are getting undermined by a nurse in front of patients despite having tried to speak to them about this?
    - Inform your consultant
    - Information gather - it is worth asking other people if they have had similar treatment - remind them that they, too, should not be expected to suffer such behaviour
    - Do not try and confront them if you have already tried this once. Note that raising the issue with the nurse involved would be the most appropriate action if this was the first time this has happened
- What to do if a colleague is struggling with the workload and their consultant is too demanding
    - Talk about concerns - offers much clearer insight and is therapeutic
    - suggest she speaks to speciality trainee - more support
    - Offer to go with her and speak with the consultant - address the problem
    - Don't offer to help or ask others to be supportive as this can increase feelings that she cant cope
- What to do if you are really busy and need help on the wards?
    - You can ask for help from another F1 who is not busy
    - Also make your speciality trainee aware of the situation and asking for help is appropriate
    - If this is an ongoing problem you can inform your consultant
- If a patient wants to leave the hospital and has capacity to make this decision?
    - Call reg to persuade them to stay if you have already tried
    - If he still wants to allow him to leave with a self discharge
- What to do if a patient's condition has changed worryingly and you do not have sufficient experience to deal with this?
    - Immediately assess the patient with someone, a ward nurse is best here
    - Get advice from your senior members of your team and you can also include wider members such as physios but this is done later
- What to do if a delirious man has punched a nurse
    - Try to talk them down
    - Call security
    - Make sure the person who was punched is ok
    - Don't reassure patients its safe if it isn't
- What to do if a patient is loud, demanding treatment and threatens violence to other patients
    - Call security
    - Support other patients
    - Inform them the behaviour will not be tolerated

Apology

- What types of mistakes can come up in the SJT
    - You make a mistake vs a colleague making a mistake
    - A mistake that leads to patient harm
    - A near miss, where harm to the patient was avoided in time
    - A mistake that did not have any impact on the patient
- What do you do if you make an error which causes significant patient harm (e.g. a prescription error?
    - Put the matter right first - cross out prescripton
    - Apologise to the patient
    - Explain fully what happened and the short and long effects - duty of candour
    - Also, contribute to adverse event recognition (comes after the immediate steps above) by filling in a clinical incident form or talking to your team about it
- What to do if a colleague makes an error
    - Put the matter right
    - You can apologise on behalf of the institution to the patient
    - Inform the colleague of the mistake
- What to do if a patient with dementia is abusive towards you or a member of staff?
    - Document incident
    - Inform colleagues
    - Complete clinical incident form even if it is minor
- When is it not immediately necessary to apologise to a patient for an error?
    - If they are confused and may be unable to take in what you are saying

Handover

- What to do if its busy and an FY1 has not turned up to handover?
    - Inform consultant or SpR
    - Offer to stay late and prioritise patients according to clinical need
    - Handover to another member of your team if they are not going to arrive soon
    - fill in the clinical incident if the doctor just doesn't turn up with no valid reason
- What to do if you have to go to handover and a nurse wants you to prescribe something before?
    - Dont prescribe without doing a proper job - any options which ensures this are best
    - Hand this over as an urgent task to the night team is ideal.  Hand over to another doc also appropriate
    - COMMS - explain to the nurse clearly your reason why there may be a delay in doing their task and tell them when you will do it
- What is the priority before handing over?
    - Finishing clinical tasks
    - You can ask for extra help from an FY1 colleague in order to get your tasks done before the shift ends
    - Seniors do not need to be aware of non-urgent incomplete tasks

- When is it acceptable to stay late?
    - When there is a distinct clinical need for it
    - Should be avoided where possible but staying late every now and again is part of the job
