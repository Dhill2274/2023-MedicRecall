Maintaining patient focus

- What should be your number one priority in any scenario
    - Patient safety, dignity or comfort
    - If this is compromised, you must take prompt action as your first priority
    - Resource - Good Medical Practice Paragraph 25
- How many times should you attempt a procedure (e.g. cannulation) before asking another doctor to try?
    - Generally recommended that after 2 failed attempts, you ask another colleague to try (this depends on hospital guidelines)
- What if emergency treatment is needed for an unconscious patient
    - You can act in their best interests
    - Inform next of kin and get senior input
- What do you do when a patient has concerns about how their data is being used (3 actions)
    - Explore the concerns
    - Address these concerns and reassure them if their concerns are not true
    - Contribute to a long-term solution to this - ask the ward manager to communicate with patients that their data will not be used without consent
- Is it acceptable to not tell a patient about the results of a test?
    - yes, you do not have to tell them the results of a test if they explicitly say that they do not want to know
    - But you should explain the implications of this choice, find out why not, and record this conversation in the notes
- How to manage a patients request to die at home?
    - Say that the team will take into account his wishes
    - Discuss at MDT
    - Involve GP
    - only involve family with explicit consent
- What to do if a patient makes a complaint about you?
    - Discuss concerns with the patient
    - offer a senior member of team to speak to
    - Inform of PALS
- What if you have a suspicion of elder abuse?
    - Document any evidence or discussion
    - Take a detailed history
    - Flag the issue to the vulnerable adults team
    - Involve a senior is also appropriate
- A patient with dementia tells you they are being abused in their care home
    - tell consultant - dealing with this is not within the remit of an F1
    - Calling the police may be better than calling the care home yourself as they may be complicit and thick could harm the investigation

Driving

- What should you do if a patient has a condition or is undergoing treatment that may affect their ability to drive (e.g. epilepsy)
    - Explain that their condition may affect their ability to drive and tell them that they have a legal duty to inform the DVLA or DVA
    - tell the patient that you may be obliged to
    disclose relevant medical information about
    them, in confidence, to the DVLA or DVA if
    they continue to drive when they are not fit
    to do so
    - make a note of any advice you have given to
    a patient about their fitness to drive in their
    medical record.

- What would you do if a patient continues to drive after being told not to?
    - You should make every reasonable effort
    to persuade them to stop.
    - If you do not manage to persuade the patient to stop driving, or you discover that they are continuing to drive against your advice, you should consider whether the patient’s refusal to stop driving leaves others exposed to a risk of death or serious harm.
    - If you believe that it does, you should contact
    the DVLA or DVA promptly and disclose any
    relevant medical information, in confidence, to
    the medical adviser.
    - As an FY1 you will not need to handle this situation alone and so should involve this to a senior

- How is the DNA CPR decision made?
    - The responsibility for this decision lies ultimately with the senior doctor looking after the patient (consultant or registrar)

    - The wishes of relatives are less important
- Who can sign a DNA CPR?
    - Anyone that has a full licence (F2 and above can sign this form) but junior members need to have it countersigned by the responsible consultant
    - Not FY1s
    - Can have initial discussions
