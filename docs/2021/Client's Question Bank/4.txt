Working with FY1 colleagues

- What to do if you suspect a colleague (another FY1) has been drinking alcohol?
    - confirm any suspicion (ask them about it)
    - Tell them to go home (unfit to work)
    - Ask for advice from a senior colleague
- Should you tell another F1 off for doing something wrong (private work to get more money which is against NHS rules)?
    - No such advice should be given by a senior, not your ultimate responsibility so you should tell them to go to their educational supervisor
    - Seniors can advise that what they are doing is against NHS rules
    - But you can suggest they stop doing whether if wrong
- What should you do if another FY1 in your team is always late?
    - Approach them about it - this is good information gathering and
    - If the problem persists and it affects your work then ask a senior colleague as well
- What to do if a FY1 asks you for advice about an issue about another FY1
    - It is the colleague's duty to act, you should only advise
    - You can advise them to speak to the other colleague directly and seek senior advice
    - Ask if patient safety is being compromised - Good information gathering
    - Give the colleague in question an opportunity to act before reporting
- What if the F1 coming on refuses to take your handover
    - Assert yourself and say it is their responsibility to do so
    - Then find another doctor to do it
    - Or write clear instructions to be followed
- Another F1 is not doing all their jobs and looks to be taking it easy
    - Ask them about it
    - Getting a second opinion good - inform an educational supervisor or senior another FY1 also good but not as good
    - patient safety is also at risk so you should try and resolve it quickly and
    - But straight away reporting them without allowing a period of reflection or change is poor teamworking
- If an FY1 is signing in to teaching but leaving
    - Inform them of the wrongdoing - this is against GMC integrity
    - Explain the importance of teaching
    - advice from an educational supervisor or clinical supervisor before colleagues
    - director of education is heavy-handed and may break down barriers
- How to approach the scenario where an F1 colleague is not doing well at the job and is putting more work on others?
    - Always first approach them yourself
    - Alongside this offer them help with something they are struggling with as long as it does not impact on your ability to care for patients
    - Can also ask the person who complained about this F1 to approach them directly
    - If no resolution, escalation steps are to involve seniors or supervisors and gather information on others about misconduct
- What if an FY1 approaches you to complain about a colleague who you know well and have not witnessed the bad behaviour
    - Tell them to approach the colleague directly
    - Should aways share concerns about other FY1s with a senior colleague
    - Ask if patient safety was compromised - this changes the scenario (immediately contact senior)
    - Dont act as a third party between james and mark (if you haven't noticed it you should not be acting)
- A FY1 colleague asks you to speak to their consultant on their behalf because their consultant is behaving inappropriately?
    - 1st offer to go with them
    - then advise they go themselves before you go without them
- What to do if an FY1 colleague is not coping well and considering quitting?
    - Advise then to speak to their clincal or educational supervisor (offer to go with them if this seems appropriate in the scenario)
    - Explore why they are feeling that way (speak to colleagues and offer support
    - Advise that they speak to a GP if their is any indication of mental or physical health problems
- Should you help another F1 with their prioritisation skills?
    - This is within the remit of their clinical supervisor not you
    - Helping a colleague in a simpler way such as giving them advice on how to handover may be more appropriate
    - You can lend an empathetic ear to FY1 colleagues who are struggling but seniors are better placed to give advice on how to improve clinical skills
- Should you check over the drug charts of another FY1 if they ask you to?
    - No should be done by someone senior if there is any doubt about how they are being filled in
    - You are the same grade as them so should not be verifying their work or acting in any way like their supervisor or senior

Working with seniors

- What to do if you suspect a senior (Registrar) has been drinking alcohol?
    - As a general rule, you should always challenge behaviour with the person involved first
    - However, if they are not going to see patients immediately, it would be better to inform their senior (a consultant) as are best placed to deal with the situation.
    - If you challenged them, there may be no guarantee they would listen to you and could be disruptive to working relationships
    
- Should you inform your reg of incomplete non-urgent tasks?
    - Not appropriate
- An issue with consent has arose, the patient does not seem to understand the procedure despite being consented
    - Try to resolve the situation and check pts understanding
    - Ask the person who consented the patient to review them
    - Informing consultants is also appropriate only if it cant be resolved as its their ultimate responsibility
- 3 good actions if a consultant is asking you to do too many tasks in a short time
    - Tell them the tasks will be completed soon
    - Explain how long they took - avoiding confrontation
    - contact your educational supervisor for advice
    - If there is no clinical urgency, do not pass over jobs to other FY1s
- What to do if your consultant is calling you an inappropriate name
    - Talk to them about how this is affecting you  (most appropriate)
    - Speak to educational supervisor
    - Contat BMA - (more of a role if a formal complaint was put in)
    - Put in a complaint (only if it does not resolve after appropriate warnings)
    - Dont secretly record conversations
- What to do if your consultant is asking you to give special care to a relative staying at the hospital
    - This is an inappropriate request as you are not the proper person to ask about this - they need to contact the doctors directly responsible for the realives care - just like anyone else
    - So you can inform them that you are not supposed to do it - challenging an inappropriate request
    - Point them in the direction of the proper channels - have you spoken to the doctors responsible for their care
- What should you do if a family have issues with a consultant's decision about a post mortem?
    - Listen to concerns and ask the consultant to review his decision with the family
    - Post mortem only done if you cant fill out death certificate

Working with the MDT

- Can you ask a nurse to update relatives on the condition of a patient
    - yes, nurses often update relatives on the condition of pateints
    - However, if the relative specifically asks to speak with a doctor then you should respond to this request yourself
- A member of staff is using racist or homophobic language, what should you do?
    - Challenge it - ideally in a non-confrontational way
    - Report incident to the line manager (their direct senior)
- Who to consult when you are not sure about a prescription?
    - Your direct senior colleague
    - Another senior colleague who will know the answer
    - The BNF
    - Ask what is normally given from the nurses
    - Consult national guidelines (not preferable) local guidelines include info specific to the area
- Do you treat a patient when told by the nurse you should call a senior despite being confident in the management?
    - If the senior is busy, prioritise timely patient care and initiate treatment and an initial assessment before later asking for senior input
    - Explain to the nurse that it is within your competency
- A nurse is rude to you and won't do some important bloods because the ward is too busy
    - either do the bloods yourself or if you are past your shift then ask the FY1 to do it
    - in a situation like this information gathering is good so you could talk to the nurse in charge about the protocol for taking bloods at busy times
    - Then address the way that the nurse spoke to you, could be the next day at a less busy moment
- What if a nurse asks you to do something (e.g. prescribing a sleeping tablet) that another F1 has previously refused to do?
    - Ask the other F1 why they refused - easiest way to get relevant info
    - Then review patient
    - Blindly agreeing to something like prescribing a drug could cause more harm than not doing anything
    - Asking them to approach the F1 for clarification in the future is also good
- How to manage a disagreement in opinion regarding patient management between a physio and yourself
    - call reg on call
    - then consultant
    - Do not accept their opinion or give the patient a treatment that you are not sure about
    - lying about a clinical scenario to get your way is the worst
- What to do if a member of the MDT is doing something against GMC guidance e.g. looking up the notes of a patient not under their care?
    - Challenge them and say its inappropriate
    - Contacting their line manager also appropriate
    - inform your consultant
- Can you get a medical student to take blood for you
    - yes
    - If it is within their competency, they don't need supervision (final-year could take bloods on their own but 2nd year may not be able to)

Common teamworking scenarios

- What if there is an indication of bullying or harassment within your team
    - Challenge colleague
    - The person being harassed - speak to the trainer
    - Then if the behaviour does not change involve the dean
    - offer advice if asked
- What to do if you feel undermined or dominated within your team
    - Raise concerns with team members first
    - Ask for senior advice
    - Doccument
- GMC guidance dealing with a colleague is not fit to practice
    - 'If you have concerns that a colleague may not be fit to practice and may be putting patients at risk, you must ask for advice from a colleague, your defence body or us. If you are still concerned you must report this, in line with our guidance and your workplace policy, and make a record of the steps you have taken'
    - Talk to the doctor involved
- You get some inconclusive evidence of wrongdoing by another member of your team, what is the first thing you should do?
    - Information gather - ask the colleague involved for more info
    - Dont jump to conclusions
